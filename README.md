I like good quotes so i started adding qoutes that i like to my mongodb database and I created this project that uses twilio's API to send messages. The app gets a random quote from my databse and gets a list of contacts also from my mongodb collection and sends that quote to everyone in my contacts collection. Have Scheduled this program as a task on my server so it runs once a day and sends a quote to everyone daily.

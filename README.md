So, hereâ€™s the scoop! ðŸŽ‰ Iâ€™ve been collecting all my favorite quotes â€“ you know, the ones that really hit home â€“ and popping them into my MongoDB database. Then I thought, why keep all the good vibes to myself?

Enter Project HypeMan (okay, might change the name, but it sounds cool). Using Twilioâ€™s API magic, Iâ€™ve set up a program that grabs a random quote from my database, fetches a list of contacts also from my database, and poof! sends that quote out to everyone! Scheduled it to run like clockwork on my server so every day, everyone on my list gets a fresh dose of wisdom at 4pm. Why 4pm? Don't ask me that. It's end of day almost, you need that pump to do better and I got you.

It's a free Twilio account so only have a $15 credit for messages once that runs out, no more texts.

A little daily inspiration, coming right up! ðŸŒŸ
